## Introduction
The "Music Generation using LSTM" project is an exploration of the creative possibilities offered by artificial intelligence and recurrent neural networks (LSTM) in the realm of music composition. This project seeks to generate original music compositions autonomously, providing a source of inspiration, experimentation, and innovation for musicians, composers, and music enthusiasts.

## Key Features

- LSTM-Based Composition: Use LSTM neural networks to compose music with structure and coherence.
- Randomness and Creativity: Generate entirely new music compositions that showcase creativity.
- Composition Export: Export generated music in various formats (e.g., MIDI, audio).
- Artistic Expression: Integrate generated music into multimedia projects, art installations, or live performances.

## Data Description
[This](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi) is the dataset I have used for making this music generator using LSTM. I have used MIDI files of music compositions by Albeniz and Chopin in this project. The midi files contain piano chords or piano notes. We analyse these MIDI files by extracting their notes, printing the music sheets, and converting them into .wav and .mp3 files.
